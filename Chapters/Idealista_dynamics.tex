\section{Introduction}

\section{Data}

We use the dataset, mentioned in section \ref{sec:Datasets}, of listings published on the portal \texttt{Idealista.com} \cite{idealista}. The dataset covers a 2-year time period, from January 2017 to December 2018 and it comprises a comprehensive collection of online listings geolocated with their (lat, long) coordinates in the Spanish provinces of Balearic Islands, Barcelona, and Madrid. These listings were posted by real estate agencies for renting or selling residential properties. Posted listings by private individuals are not included into the dataset.

Each listing contains a set of attributes such as the price, the surface area, the real estate agency that posted it, its location and the dates of both the publication and the removal of the listing. The dataset also contains information about the type of property (e.g. flat, house, etc.), what allowed us to filter rural parcels and commercial properties. We also removed listings with missing or inconsistent information, such as irregular prices or surface areas. Through this article, the main results are shown for the selling market, but the same analysis stands for the renting market as well.

\section{Listings dynamics}

\end{figure}

We begin by analyzing the temporal dynamics of the listings. To do so, we consider as total listings, the listings that have been posted in the online platform before a given ime $t$, and active listings those that are available in the platform at a given time $t$. Fig. \ref{fig:active_adds} shows the daily number of total listings and active listings for the Barcelona province, which shows a representative behavior for all regions. The total number of listings increases linearly with time during the studied period, with no significant variations, showing that new listings are continuously added to the platform. On the other hand, the number of active listings shows a weekly pattern, with a peak on Wednesday and a minimum on the weekends, consistent with human activity patterns in online platforms \cite{szell2010multirelational}. This weekly pattern is more evident when zooming into a 1-month period, as shown in the inset of Fig. \ref{fig:active_adds}. Moreover, the number of active listings shows an increasing linear trend, which indicates that the number of listings available in the platform is growing over time. This trend is found in all regions for both renting and selling, what highlights the non-stationary nature of the listings' dynamics.

Listings life (time posted in the platform) distribution for different time windows at Madrid \textbf{(a)}, Barcelona \textbf{(b)} and Balearic Islands \textbf{(c)}. Different colors indicate different time windows. \textbf{(d)} Inter-activations time distribution for the 3 regions. Different colors indicate different region or province. The dashed black line shows a $\nu^{-2}$ power-law distribution. \textbf{(e)} and \textbf{(f)} show the bar sequence of the adds deactivations and activations, respectively, for the Balearic Islands market. The color intensity indicates the number of adds.}
\end{figure}

The active listings dynamics is governed by the listings life, defined as the number of days a certain listing has been posted in the platform. 



\section{Agencies dynamics}

\subsection{Preferential attachment}

For both plots, different colors and markers indicate different regions or provinces. In \textbf{(a)}, the black dashed line shows a power-law distribution with exponent $\alpha  =-2$, and in \textbf{(b)} shows a linear increase with fitted slope $C = 0.04$.}

Different colors and markers indicate different regions or provinces. The black dashed line shows a linear fit with $\sigma = p^{{m}^2}$ for both plots.}

These plots correspond to the Madrid housing market. For the price distributions, the colors indicate histograms for different agencies.}
