Binary-state models are a versatile tool to describe a variety of natural and social phenomena in systems formed by many interacting agents. Each agent is considered to be in one of two possible states: susceptible/infected, adopters/non-adopters, democrat/republican, etc, depending on the context of the model. The interaction among agents is determined by the underlying network and the dynamical rules of the model. There are many examples of binary-state models, including processes of opinion formation \cite{Voter-original,sood-2005,fernandez-gracia-2014,redner-2019}, disease or social contagion \cite{granovetter-1978,pastor-satorras-2015}, etc. Extended and modified versions of these models can lead to very different dynamical behaviors than in the original model. As examples, the use of multi-layer  \cite{diakonova-2014,diakonova-2016,amato-2017} or time-dependent networks \cite{vazquez-2008}, higher-order interactions \cite{de-arruda-2020, iacopini-2019, cencetti-2021}, non-linear collective phenomena \cite{castellano-2009,peralta-2018}, noise \cite{carro-2016} and non-Markovian \cite{van-mieghem-2013,starnini-2017,peralta-2020A,chen-2020} effects induce significant changes to the dynamics.

\footnote{We use here the term  ``master equation'' for consistency with  Refs. \cite{gleeson-2011,gleeson-2013}, but the word ``master'' has a different meaning than the one used to describe an equation for the probability distribution \cite{peralta-2020B}}

We consider  binary-state dynamics on static, undirected, connected networks assuming a locally tree-like structure and in the limit of $N \to \infty$, following closely the approach used in Ref. \cite{gleeson-2013} for binary-state dynamics in complex networks. The new ingredient  is to consider the nodes with different "age" or "internal time" as different sets, what allows us to treat as Markovian the memory effects introduced by aging \cite{peralta-2020C,peralta-2020A}. We define $x^{\pm}_{k,m,j} (t)$ as the fraction of nodes that are in state $\pm 1$ and have degree $k$, $m$ infected neighbors and age $j$ at time $t$. The networks have degree distribution $p_k$ and have been generated by the configuration model \cite{molloy-1995,newman-2001}. For the models considered in this thesis, the initial condition is set such that all agents have age $j = 0$ and there is a randomly chosen fraction $x^{-}_{0}$ of nodes in state $-1$:
\begin{flalign}
    \label{initial_condition} 
    \textrm{For } j > 0 & \quad \quad    x^{+}_{k,m,j} (0) = 0 \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \; \; x^{-}_{k,m,j} (0) = 0, \nonumber\\
    \textrm{For } j = 0 & \quad \quad    x^{+}_{k,m,0} (0) = (1 -  x^{-}_{0})\, B_{k,m}[x^{-}_{0}] \quad  x^{-}_{k,m,0} (0) = x^{-}_{0}\, B_{k,m}[x^{-}_{0}],
\end{flalign}
where $B_{k,m}[x^{-}_{0}]$ is the binomial distribution with $k$ attempts, $m$ successes and $x^{-}_{0}$ is the initial fraction of agents in state $-1$ (as the probability of success of the binomial). Now, we examine how $x^{+}_{k,m,j}$ changes in a time step. We consider 3 possible events:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An agent changes state from $+1$ to $-1$ and resets the internal time to $j = 0$, with probability $T^{+} (k,m,j)$.
    \item An agent remains at its state and resets its internal time to $j = 0$, with probability $R^{+} (k,m,j)$.
    \item An agent remains at its state and ages, with probability $A^{+} (k,m,j)$.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, for $j>0$, we reach the expressions of Eq. \eqref{eq:pre_AME} (see Fig. \ref{fig:ame_plot1} for a schematic representation of transitions involving $x^{+}_{k,m,j}$ and $x^{-}_{k,m,j}$):
\begin{flalign} \label{eq:pre_AME}
        x^{+}_{k,m,j} (t + dt) = & \, x^{+}_{k,m,j}(t) - T^{+} (k,m,j)\, x^{+}_{k,m,j}\, dt - R^{+} (k,m,j)\, x^{+}_{k,m,j} \, dt - A^{+} (k,m,j) \, x^{+}_{k,m,j} \, dt \nonumber \\
        & + A^{+} (k,m,j-1)\,  x^{+}_{k,m,j-1} \, dt - \omega (x^{+}_{k,m,j} \to x^{+}_{k,m+1,j+1}) \, x^{+}_{k,m,j}\, dt \\
        & - \omega (x^{+}_{k,m,j} \to x^{+}_{k,m-1,j+1})\,  x^{+}_{k,m,j} \, dt + \omega (x^{+}_{k,m+1,j-1} \to x^{+}_{k,m,j}) \, x^{+}_{k,m+1,j-1} \, dt \nonumber \\
        & + \omega (x^{+}_{k,m-1,j-1} \to x^{+}_{k,m-1,j-1}) \, x^{+}_{k,m-1,j-1}\,  dt. \nonumber
\end{flalign}
The case $j = 0$ needs to be treated differently from $j > 0$ because there is an injection of nodes into this set due to the resetting event:
\begin{flalign}
        \label{eq:pre_AME_0}
        x^{+}_{k,m,0} (t + dt) = &\,  x^{+}_{k,m,0}(t) - T^{+} (k,m,0) \, x^{+}_{k,m,0} \, dt + \sum_{l = 0}^{\infty} T^{-} (k,m,l)\,  x^{-}_{k,m,l} \, dt + \sum_{l = 1}^{\infty} R^{+} (k,m,l)\,  x^{+}_{k,m,l}\,  dt   \nonumber\\
        & - T^{+} (k,m,0)\,  x^{+}_{k,m,0}\,  dt - \omega (x^{+}_{k,m,0} \to x^{+}_{k,m+1,1}) \, x^{+}_{k,m,0}\,  dt - \omega (x^{+}_{k,m,0} \to x^{+}_{k,m-1,1})\,  x^{+}_{k,m,0} \, dt.
\end{flalign}
Similar equations can be found considering transitions for $x^{-}_{k,m,j}$ and $x^{-}_{k,m,0}$. Notice that we have considered no transition increasing (or decreasing) the number of $-1$ neighbors $m$, keeping constant the age $j$. This is because the age $j$ is defined as the time spent in the current state (or since a reset). Therefore, if a node remains in its state and the number of neighbors in state $-1$ changes ($m \to m \pm 1$), the age of the node must increase ($j \to j + 1$). To determine the rate of these events, we use the same assumption as in Ref. \cite{gleeson-2013}: we assume that the number of $++$ (edges between agents in state $+1$) edges change to $+-$ edges at a time-dependent rate $\beta^{+}$. Therefore, the transition rates are:
    \begin{align} \label{rate_beta_s}
    &  \omega (x^{+}_{k,m,j} \to s_{k,m+1,j+1}) = (k - m) \, \beta^{+}, \nonumber \\
    & \omega (s_{k,m-1,j-1} \to x^{+}_{k,m,j}) = (k - m + 1)\, \beta^{+} . 
    \end{align}
To determine the rate $\beta^{+}$, we count the change of $++$ edges that change to $+-$ in a time step. This change is produced by a neighbor of a node in state $+1$ changing state from $+1$ to $-1$. Thus, we can extract this information from the transition probability $T^{+}(k,m,j)$:
\begin{equation}
        \label{beta_s}
        \beta^{+} = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} (k - m)\, T^{+} (k,m,j) \, x^{+}_{k,m,j}}{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} (k - m) \, x^{+}_{k,m,j}}.
\end{equation}
A similar approximation is used to determine the transition rates at which $+-$ edges change to $++$ edges. We write:
\begin{align} \label{rate_gamma_s}
    &  \omega (x^{+}_{k,m,j} \to x^{+}_{k,m-1,j+1}) = m\, \gamma^{+}, \nonumber \\
    & \omega (x^{+}_{k,m+1,j-1} \to x^{+}_{k,m,j}) = (m + 1)\, \gamma^{+} ,
\end{align}
where the rate $\gamma^{+}$ is computed using the opposite transition probability $T^{-}(k,m,j)$:
\begin{equation}
        \label{gamma_s}
        \gamma^{+} = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} (k - m)\, T^{-} (k,m,j) \, x^{-}_{k,m,j}}{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} (k - m)\,  x^{-}_{k,m,j}}.
\end{equation}
    
For standard models, one natural assumption is to consider the probability to age as the probability of neither changing state nor resetting:
\begin{align} \label{cond_1}
    &  T^{+} (k,m,j) + A^{+} (k,m,j) + R^{+} (k,m,j) = 1, \nonumber\\
    &  T^{-} (k,m,j) + A^{-} (k,m,j) + R^{-} (k,m,j) = 1.
    \end{align}
    With this condition, taking the limit $dt \to 0$ of Eqs. \eqref{eq:pre_AME}-\eqref{eq:pre_AME_0}, we obtain the approximate master equation (AME) for the evolution of the different sets $x^{\pm}_{k,m,j}$ and $x^{\pm}_{k,m,0}$:
    \begin{align}
    \label{eq:AME}
        \frac{d x^{\pm}_{k,m,j}}{dt} = & \, - x^{\pm}_{k,m,j} - (k - m)\, \beta^{\pm}\,  x^{\pm}_{k,m,j} - m \, \gamma^{\pm}\, x^{\pm}_{k,m,j} + (k-m+1)\, \beta^{\pm} \,   x^{\pm}_{k,m-1,j-1} \nonumber\\
        & + (m+1)\, \gamma^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m+1,j-1} + A^{\pm} (k,m,j-1)\,  x^{\pm}_{k,m,j-1},  \\
        \frac{d x^{\pm}_{k,m,0}}{dt}  = & \, - x^{\pm}_{k,m,0} - (k - m) \, \beta^{\pm}\,  x^{\pm}_{k,m,0} - m\, \gamma^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m,0} + \sum_{l = 0}^{\infty} T^{\mp} (k,m,l)\,  x^{\mp}_{k,m,l} + \sum_{l = 0}^{\infty} R^{\pm} (k,m,l)\, x^{\pm}_{k,m,l},\nonumber
    \end{align}
    where $\beta^{-}$ ($\gamma^{-}$) are time-dependent rates that account for the transitions at which $-+$ ($--$) edges change to $--$ ($-+$) edges:
    \begin{align}
        \beta^{-} = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} m \, T^{+} (k,m,j) \, x^{+}_{k,m,j}}{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} (k - m)\,  x^{-}_{k,m,j}} \quad \quad \gamma^{-} = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} m\, T^{-} (k,m,j) \, x^{-}_{k,m,j}}{\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} m\,  x^{-}_{k,m,j}}.
    \end{align}
    Equations \ref{eq:AME} define a closed set of deterministic differential equations that can be solved numerically using standard computational methods for any complex network and any model aging via the transition, reset and aging probabilities (a general script in Julia is available in a GitHub repository \cite{link_git}).
    
    The binary-state model is introduced via the transition probabilities ($T^{\pm}, A^{\pm}, R^{\pm}$), which may depend on the degree $k$, the number $m$ of neighbors in state $-1$ and the time spent in the actual state (or since a reset) $j$. For the Granovetter-Watts model with aging (chapter \ref{ch:Aging in binary state dynamics: The Granovetter-Watts model}), dynamics are monotonic and there are no age dynamics once the agent is state $-1$ ($T^{-} (k,m,j) = A^{-} (k,m,j) = R^{-} (k,m,j) = 0$). Therefore, the equations for $x^{+}_{k,m,0}$ decouples from the equations for the variables $x^{-}_{k,m,j}$, reducing the equations to:
    \begin{align}
    \label{eq:AME_Threshold_AP}
        \frac{d x^{+}_{k,m,j}}{dt}  = & \, - x^{+}_{k,m,j} - (k - m)\, \beta^{+} \,   x^{+}_{k,m,j} + (k-m+1) \, \beta^{+} \,  x^{+}_{k,m-1,j-1} + A^{+} (k,m,j-1)\,  x^{+}_{k,m,j-1},  \\
        \frac{d x^{+}_{k,m,0}}{dt}  = & \,  - x^{+}_{k,m,0} - (k - m)\, \beta^{+} \,  x^{+}_{k,m,0} + \sum_{l = 0}^{\infty} R^{+} (k,m,l) \, x^{+}_{k,m,l} . \nonumber
    \end{align}
    For the Symmetrical Threshold model with aging (chapter \ref{ch:Aging implications in the Symmetrical Threshold model}), this monotonic approximation is no longer valid. On the other hand, for this model we do not consider age resetting ($R^{\pm} (k,m,j) = 0$) since aging is "endogenous". Therefore, the equations to solve are:
    \begin{align}
    \label{eq:AME_Threshold_SP}
        \frac{d x^{\pm}_{k,m,j}}{dt}  = & \, - x^{\pm}_{k,m,j} - (k - m)\, \beta^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m,j} - m\, \gamma^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m,j} + (k-m+1)\, \beta^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m-1,j-1} \nonumber\\
        & \, + (m+1)\, \gamma^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m+1,j-1} + A^{\pm} (k,m,j-1)\,  x^{\pm}_{k,m,j-1},\\
        \frac{d x^{\pm}_{k,m,0}}{dt}  = & \, - x^{\pm}_{k,m,0} - (k - m)\, \beta^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m,0} - m\, \gamma^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m,0} + \sum_{l = 0}^{\infty} T^{\mp} (k,m,l) \,  x^{\mp}_{k,m,l}.\nonumber 
    \end{align}

    \section{\label{sec:Reduction to Markovian dynamics}  Reduction to Markovian dynamics}

    When there are neither resetting events ($R^{\pm} (k,m,j) = 0$) and the transition probabilities do not depend on the internal time $j$ ,$T^{\pm} (k,m,j) = T^{\pm} (k,m)$ and $A^{\pm} (k,m,j) = 1 - T^{\pm} (k,m)$, our dynamics are Markovian. In this case, if we are not interested in the solutions $x^{\pm}_{k,m,j} (t)$, Eq. \ref{eq:AME_age} can be reduced by summing variable $j$. We define $x^{\pm}_{k,m} = \sum_{j} x^{\pm}_{k,m,j}$ as the fraction of nodes that are in state $\pm 1$ and have degree $k$ and $m$ infected neighbors. The equations for the variables $x^{\pm}_{k,m}$ are:
    \begin{align}
    \label{eq:AME_noage}
        \frac{d x^{\pm}_{k,m}}{dt}  = & \, - x^{\pm}_{k,m} - (k - m)\, \beta^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m} - m\, \gamma^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m} + (k-m+1)\, \beta^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m-1} \, + (m+1)\, \gamma^{\pm} \,  x^{\pm}_{k,m+1},
    \end{align}
    where the rates $\beta^{\pm}$ and $\gamma^{\pm}$ are redefined as follows:
    \begin{align}
        & \beta^{+} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} (k - m)\, T^{+} (k,m) \, x^{+}_{k,m}}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} (k - m)\,  x^{-}_{k,m}}, \quad \quad \gamma^{+} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} (k-m)\, T^{+} (k,m) \, x^{+}_{k,m}}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} m\,  x^{+}_{k,m}}, \nonumber\\
        & \beta^{-} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} m \, T^{+} (k,m) \, x^{+}_{k,m}}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} (k - m)\,  x^{-}_{k,m}}, \quad \quad \quad \quad \; \gamma^{-} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} m\, T^{-} (k,m) \, x^{-}_{k,m}}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k \sum_{m = 0}^{k} m\,  x^{-}_{k,m}}.
    \end{align}
    Notice that this reduction is not an approximation and there is no loss of accuracy. The reduction to Markovian dynamics is a consequence of the chosen model. Equations \ref{eq:AME_noage} correspond to the equations derived by J.P. Gleeson \cite{gleeson-2013} for binary-state dynamics in complex networks. This is a set of $(k_{\rm max}+1)(k_{\rm max}+1)$ differential equations that can be solved numerically using standard computational methods for any complex network and any model via the transition probabilities $T^{\pm} (k,m)$.

    For the Symmetrical threshold model (chapter \ref{ch:Ordering dynamics in the Symmetrical Threshold model}), the dynamics are Markovian since the transition rates (if we forget about the age dynamics) are:

    \begin{align}
        T^{+} (k,m) = \theta \left(\frac{m}{k} - T \right) \quad \quad T^{-} (k,m) = \theta \left( \frac{k-m}{k} - T \right).
    \end{align}

    \section{\label{sec:Heterogeneous mean-field approximation}  Heterogeneous mean-field approximation (HMF)}

    Moreover, from Eqs. \eqref{eq:AME_noage}, we can perform a heterogeneous mean-field approximation (HMF) to reduce our system to $k_{\rm max}+1$ differential equations \cite{gleeson-2013}:
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{d}{d t} x^{-}_{k}= &- x^{-}_{k} \sum_{m=0}^{k} T^{-}_{k, m} B_{k, m}[\omega] +\left(1-x^{-}_{k}\right) \sum_{m=0}^{k} T^{+}_{k, m} B_{k, m}[\omega],
    \label{eq:HMF}
    \end{eqnarray}
    where $x^{-}_{k} = \sum_{m=0}^{k} x^{-}_{k,m}$ and $\omega= \sum_k p_k \frac{k}{z} x^{-}_{k}$. This system of differential equations, coupled via $\omega$, cannot be solved analytically. However, it can be solved numerically using standard computational methods.

    In particular, for the Symmetrical Threshold model, HMF predicts a mixed-ordered transition line that qualitatively captures the critical line dependence but quantitatively differs from the numerical simulations (see the red dashed line in Figs. \ref{ER_REG_PD}a and \ref{ER_REG_PD}b and the dotted colored lines in Fig. \ref{ER_REG_PD}c). Moreover, this approximation does not predict a frozen phase in any of the networks considered. Instead, for high values of $T$, the integrated stationary solutions are always $m_f = \pm 1$, regardless of $m_0$. From this analysis, we conclude that we need sophisticated methods beyond an HMF description to describe the Symmetrical Threshold model's phase diagram (in a random sparse network).
