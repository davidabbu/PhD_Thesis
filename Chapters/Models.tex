\section{\label{sec:Introduction} Introduction}

The contagion of ideas is a process that has been studied for many years and is present in many social systems, ranging from small groups and communities to large networks and societies at a global scale. This process, often referred to as social contagion, involves the spread of ideas, behaviors, innovations, and emotions among individuals and groups through various forms of social interaction. The metaphor of contagion highlights the similarities between the spread of infectious diseases and the transmission of ideas, where a single "infected" individual can influence multiple others, leading to widespread adoption of new behaviors or beliefs.

In this context, binary-state models have emerged as a versatile tool to describe a variety of natural and social phenomena in systems formed by many interacting agents. Each agent is considered to be in one of two possible states: susceptible/infected, adopters/non-adopters, democrat/republican, etc., depending on the context of the model. The interaction among agents is determined by the underlying network and the dynamical rules of the model. Examples of binary-state models include processes of opinion formation \cite{Voter-original,sood-2005,fernandez-gracia-2014,redner-2019}, disease or social contagion \cite{granovetter-1978,pastor-satorras-2015}, among others. Extended and modified versions of these models can lead to very different dynamical behaviors than in the original model. As examples, the use of multi-layer  \cite{diakonova-2014,diakonova-2016,amato-2017} or time-dependent networks \cite{vazquez-2008}, higher-order interactions \cite{de-arruda-2020, iacopini-2019, cencetti-2021}, non-linear collective phenomena \cite{castellano-2009,peralta-2018}, noise \cite{carro-2016} and non-Markovian \cite{van-mieghem-2013,starnini-2017,peralta-2020A,chen-2020} effects induce significant changes to the dynamics.

With the advent of network theory and the increasing availability of large-scale data from online platforms, researchers have been able to study the contagion of ideas with unprecedented precision and detail. Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz's small-world model \cite{watts1998collective} and Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert's work on scale-free networks provided foundational insights into the structure of social networks and their role in facilitating or hindering the spread of information and ideas \cite{barabasi2009scale}.

Recent studies have focused on the mechanisms of social contagion in digital environments, where ideas can spread rapidly and widely through social media platforms \cite{online-platforms, jstor}. Analyses have identified emotional engagement and practical value as key drivers of sharing behavior \cite{ferrara-2015, steinert-2022}. Additionally, the role of social influence on online platforms has been explored, demonstrating how peer effects can significantly impact individuals' decisions to adopt new products or ideas \cite{jensen-2015}.

The contagion of ideas also plays a critical role in the diffusion of innovations. Rogger's seminal work outlines a theory of how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technology spread through cultures, highlighting the importance of social networks and opinion leaders in the spread of new ideas \cite{rogers2014}. Peer effects and social influence have been shown to play a significant role in the adoption of new technologies, with individuals more likely to adopt new products or services if they see others in their social network doing the same \cite{valente-1996, bollinger-2012}.

\section{\label{sec:Simple and Complex Contagion} Simple and Complex Contagion}

In the study of social contagion, researchers distinguish between two main types of contagion processes: simple contagion and complex contagion. Simple contagion refers to the spread of ideas, behaviors, or innovations primarily through single exposures or interactions, much like the transmission of infectious diseases. This process is characterized by the principle that an individual's likelihood of adopting a new idea or behavior increases with each additional exposure to that idea or behavior within their social network \cite{granovetter-1978,christakis2007spread, fowler2009cooperative}. In contrast, complex contagion involves multiple exposures or reinforcements from different sources within the network, often requiring a critical mass of adopters before an individual is influenced to adopt the idea or behavior \cite{centola-2007,centola-2010}.

There are two distinguishable types of Complex contagion: {\bf Multiple pairwise interactions}, where the agent considers the interaction with multiple social contacts (interactions highlighted with dashed red lines) and {\bfseries Higher-order interactions}, where the agent considers the interaction with a group of social contacts, all at once, in a single interaction (not pairwise). The green, yellow colors represent the state (idea, position, political party...). (The hypergraph representation is from Ref. \cite{de-arruda-2020}).}
    \label{fig:SimpleComplexContagion}
\end{figure}

Simple contagion is often described as a process that involves only dyadic interactions, where the adoption of an idea or behavior is facilitated by direct contact between two individuals. This type of contagion is fundamental to understanding how information, rumors, or diseases spread through populations via direct, pairwise connections \cite{pastor2001epidemic, newman2002spread}. The dynamics of simple contagion are crucial for the rapid dissemination of information and the efficient spread of both beneficial and detrimental behaviors across social ties \cite{christakis2007spread, fowler2009cooperative}.

In contrast, complex contagion occurs in scenarios where adoption is not merely a result of dyadic interactions but also involves group dynamics and the reinforcement from multiple sources within the network. This type of contagion often requires a critical mass or threshold of adopters within an individual's social network to trigger the adoption of the idea, behavior, or innovation \cite{centola-2007,centola-2010}. Granovetter's work on threshold models of collective behavior further illuminates this concept by exploring how individual thresholds for action or adoption depend on the proportion of others adopting the behavior, highlighting the nonlinear nature of social influence and the importance of group interaction in complex contagion processes \cite{granovetter-1978}.

The multiple exposure necessary that characterizes complex contagion can be understood in two ways: (i) as a reinforcement of the idea or behavior from multiple pairwise (dyadic) interactions \cite{centola-2007,centola-2010}, or (ii) as a reinforcement from multiple sources in a group interaction (higher-order interactions) \cite{iacopini-2019,de-arruda-2020,battiston-2021}. In the first case, the peer pressure, characteristic of complex contagion processes, is included into the model, which is designed to be used a simple network of dyadic social contacts. In the second case, the group interaction is included in the higher-order network, which is a more general representation of the social contacts, where the interactions are not restricted to dyads \cite{de-arruda-2020}. See Fig. \ref{fig:SimpleComplexContagion} for a graphical representation of the different types of social interactions.

Moreover, real-world processes are influenced not solely by either simple or complex contagion mechanisms but by a complex interaction between the two (Hybrid contagion). Such multifaceted interactions give rise to varied outcomes, including phenomena like criticality, tricriticality, and echo chambers \cite{min-2018,diaz-diaz-2022}, all of which profoundly affect how information is spread, how behaviors are adopted, and how collective actions are formed.

There have been attempt to extract the simple/complex nature of a process from real data. For example, by analyzing the correlation between the infection order of network nodes and their local topology, it is possible to infer the type of contagion process that is taking place \cite{cencetti-2023}. This approach relies on observing a single instance of spreading to classify the contagion as simple, threshold-driven, or influenced by higher-order interactions, without requiring extensive data or knowledge of the network's global structure. Nevertheless, the classification of contagion processes remains a challenging task, as the dynamics of social contagion are influenced by a multitude of factors and high-quality data related to the infection process is often scarce.

\section{\label{sec:Granovetter-Watts threshold model} Granovetter-Watts threshold model}

In this thesis, we focus on the dynamics of complex contagion driven by multiple interactions in a network of dyadic social contacts (no higher-order interactions). In particular, we focus on a particular category of complex contagion models called \textbf{threshold models}.

Threshold models represent a critical conceptual framework in understanding how individual behaviors aggregate to produce collective outcomes, especially in contexts where decisions are influenced by the actions of others \cite{granovetter-1973,granovetter-1978}. By defining a "threshold" — the point at which an individual's perception of the collective behavior of others prompts them to act — these models offer insights into the pivotal role of social influence and network structure in driving large-scale changes from small initial actions \cite{dodds-2004}. Rooted in the interdisciplinary nexus of sociology, economics, and network theory, these models illuminate the mechanics behind phenomena as diverse as social movements, technological adoption, market dynamics, and even cascading failures within infrastructures. All these phenomena share a common thread: the need for a critical mass of adopters or actors to trigger a collective response, a threshold that must be crossed to initiate a cascade of actions or behaviors \cite{centola-2007,centola-2010}.

When we talk about threshold models, the model that comes to our minds is the threshold mdoel introduced by Mark Granovetter...

The so-called Threshold model was introduced to capture a situation in which the adoption of new ideas or technologies requires a certain redundancy in the social environment of each agent to take effect. This model has become a paradigm for complex contagion.

- The threshold model is used to describe processes of complex contagion based on the idea that individuals have a threshold that needs to be reached in order to adopt an idea.

- Watts (2002) proposed a simple model to study the dynamics of complex contagion based on the idea that individuals have a threshold that needs to be reached in order to adopt an idea. 

- Should I describe what is a phase transition? Maybe with a foot note.

- This model exhibits a phase transition from a regime where the adoption of an idea is rare to a regime where the adoption of an idea is common. This phase transition is discontinuous.

- This model has been studied for many social networks and many variants of the model have been proposed\dots

\section{\label{sec:The Sakoda-Schelling model} The Sakoda-Schelling model}

- Thomas C. Schelling (1975) proposed a model to study the dynamics of segregation based on the idea that individuals have a threshold that needs to be reached in order to move to a different location. 

- This model become very popular because it was able to reproduce the segregation patterns that are observed in many cities, just as an emergent phenomena from individual decisions.

- On the other hand, this model was already studied by Sakoda in 1971, in a paper that was published in Japanese, and that was not known by the scientific community. In this work, the author proposed a model to study the dynamics of segregation based on the idea that individuals have a threshold that needs to be reached in order to move to a different location.

- Schelling model is a particular case of the Sakoda model.

- This model exhibits a phase transition from a regime where the segregation is low to a regime where the segregation is high. This phase transition is discontinuous. 

Thomas Schelling introduced a simple segregation model   \cite{schelling-1969,Schelling,schellingbook,hegselmann-2017} in which agents of two colors are distributed randomly on a chess-board, leaving some locations free. Agents are unsatisfied if more than a half of the eight nearest neighbors have different color. Randomly, the unsatisfied agents will move to available satisfying locations of the neighborhood. This model has had a very significant impact for several reasons: The ``hand-made'' simulations performed by T. Schelling by moving pawns on a chessboard are an early precedent of the use of  agent-based simulations in Social Sciences. It is also one of the first social models to show emergent behavior as a result of simple interactions among agents, a characteristic of complex systems.

- Despite the many variants of the model that have been proposed, the phase transition emergent in this model is very robust.

\section{\label{sec: Bursty Human Dynamics} Bursty Human Dynamics}

- All models previously described are based in an important assumption regarding to its dynamics: the interactions between individuals occur at a constant rate.

- This constant rate assumption is assuming that the stochastic interactions follow a Poisson process. 

- However, from the analysis of many datasets of human interactions, it has been observed that the interactions between individuals are not constant, but bursty.

- The bursty behaviour is characterized by power law interevent time distributions, and it is present in many human activities, such as e-mail communication, face-to-face interactions, and phone calls.

- The modeling of bursty human dynamics is important because it allows us to understand how the bursty behaviour of human interactions affects the dynamics of social systems.

- Previous literature has several approaches to model bursty human dynamics: temporal networks, activity-driven models, aging \dots

\section{\label{sec:Aging mechanism} Aging mechanism}

- The aging mechanism is a mechanism that has been proposed to model the bursty behaviour of human interactions.

- Aging mechanism is based on the idea that the probability of an individual to interact with another individual decreases with the time since the last interaction.

- Attachment to previous beliefs or habits is a common feature in human behavior. Granovetter (1973) discussed 

- Instead of the constant rate assumption, the aging mechanism assumes that the interactions between individuals occur at a rate that decreases with the time since the last interaction.

- The focus on this approach is to include the bursty dynamics in the individuals attempts to interact with others, rather than in the interactions themselves (as in the activity-driven models or temporal networks).

It is known that human interactions do not occur at a constant rate. They rather show  a bursty character with a non-Poissonian inter-event time distribution that reflects a memory from past interactions. \cite{barabasi-2005,moro,oriol,rybski-2012,zignani-2016,kumar-2020}
However, most social simulations, including simulations of variants of the Sakoda-Schelling model, implicitly assume a constant rate of interactions or state updating. "Aging" is one form of memory effect on which the rate of interactions depends on the persistence time of an agent in a state, modifying the transition to a different state \cite{fernandez-gracia-2011,perez-2016,boguna-2014}. This concept of aging, or "social inertia" \cite{Stark2008}, constrains the transitions in a way that the longer an agent remains in a given state, the smaller the probability to change it. Aging has been already shown to modify social dynamics very significantly. For example, in opinion dynamics, aging is able to produce coarsening towards a consensus state in the voter model \cite{fernandez-gracia-2011,peralta-2020} or to induce a continuous phase transition in the noisy voter model \cite{artime-2018}.

\section{\label{sec:Aging in Simple Contagion Models} Aging in Simple Contagion Models}

- Aging in the Voter model has been studied by many authors, and it has been shown that the aging mechanism affects the dynamics of the model.

- The aging mechanism has been shown to affect the dynamics of the Voter model, and to change the phase transition of the model.

- Aging in the noisy voter model is able to change the phase transition of the model, and to make the phase transition continuous.

- Aging in the SI model is able to change the cascade size distribution of the model, and to make the cascade size distribution follow a power law (see the work of Karsai et al. 2011).
