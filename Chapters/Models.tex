In this chapter, we will explore in detail the, so called, threshold models and the concept of aging, which will be fundamental to understand the results in the following chapters of the thesis. We differentiate between simple and complex contagion models, two different information transmission mechanisms that have been widely studied in the literature. We introduce two well-known threshold models: the Granovetter-Watts threshold model, a fundamental model for understanding the dynamics of complex contagion in social networks, and the Sakoda-Schelling model, a segregation model that was a precursor of the nowadays agent-based simulations. Furthermore, we also introduce topics such as the bursty dynamics in human interactions and the role of aging, a non-Markovian mechanism that captures the tendency of individuals to stick to their previous beliefs or habits. It is shown how incorporating this factors to traditional Markovian models dramatically changes the phase diagram and the dynamics. 

\section{\label{sec:Introduction} Introduction}

Social contagion is a process that has been studied for many years and is present in many social systems, ranging from small groups and communities to large networks and societies at a global scale. This process, often referred to as social contagion \cite{christakis2013social}, involves the spread of ideas, behaviors, innovations, and emotions (spread of ``information'') among individuals and groups through various forms of social interaction. The metaphor of contagion highlights the similarities between the spread of infectious diseases and the transmission of information, where a single ``infected'' individual can influence multiple others, leading to widespread information.

In this context, binary-state models have emerged as a versatile tool to describe a variety of natural and social phenomena in systems formed by many interacting agents. Each agent is considered to be in one of two possible states: susceptible/infected, adopters/non-adopters, favor/against, etc., depending on the context of the model. In all cases, one of the states represent the presence/spreading of information and the other the absence of it. The interaction among agents is determined by the underlying network and the update rules of the model. Examples of binary-state models include processes of opinion formation and consensus \cite{Voter-original,sood-2005,fernandez-gracia-2014,redner-2019}, disease or social contagion \cite{granovetter-1978,pastor-satorras-2015}, among others. 

With the advent of network theory and the increasing availability of large-scale data from online platforms, researchers have been able to study the contagion of ideas with unprecedented precision and detail. Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz's small-world model \cite{watts1998collective} and Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert's work on scale-free networks \cite{barabasi2009scale} provided foundational insights into the structure of social networks and their role in facilitating or hindering the spread of information and ideas.

On the other hand, the desicion-making process in social systems is influenced by a variety of factors, including social media influence \cite{online-platforms, jstor}, peer pressure \cite{jensen-2015}, emotional engagement \cite{ferrara-2015, steinert-2022} and individual preferences. Peer effects and social influence have been shown to play a significant role in the adoption of new technologies, with individuals more likely to adopt new products or services if they see others in their social network doing the same \cite{rogers2014, valente-1996, bollinger-2012}.

In this chapter, we introduce the terms simple and complex contagions, two different mechanisms that describe how information spreads through social networks. Once we have defined these concepts, we move forward to introduce the Granovetter-Watts and the Sakoda-Schelling models, two fundamental models which update rules are based on a threshold mechanism, a particular case of complex interactions. We will introduce a theoretical framework useful to treat threshold models in complex networks and finally, we will introduce the concepts of bursty human dynamics and aging mechanism, which show that the Markovian assumption is not always valid in the study of social dynamics.

\section{\label{sec:Simple and Complex Contagion} Simple and Complex Contagion}

In the study of social contagion, researchers distinguish between two main types of contagion processes: simple contagion and complex contagion \cite{centola-2007}. Simple contagion refers to the spread of ideas, behaviors, or innovations primarily through single exposures or interactions, much like the transmission of infectious diseases. This process is characterized by the principle that an individual's likelihood of adopting a new idea or behavior increases with each additional exposure to that idea or behavior within their social network \cite{christakis2007spread, fowler2009cooperative}. In contrast, complex contagion involves multiple exposures or reinforcements from different sources within the network, often requiring a critical mass of adopters before an individual is influenced to adopt the idea or behavior \cite{granovetter-1978,centola-2007,centola-2010}.

\begin{figure}

    \caption[Simple and complex contagion processes]{Comparison between the different types of social interaction. {\bfseries Simple contagion}, where the agent considers just the pairwise interaction with one social contact (interaction highlighted with a dashed red line) and {\bfseries Complex contagion}, where the agent considers the interaction with multiple social contacts. There are two distinguishable types of Complex contagion: {\bfseries Multiple pairwise interactions}, where the agent considers the interaction with all social contacts (interactions highlighted with dashed red lines) and {\bfseries Higher-order interactions}, where the agent considers the interaction with a group of social contacts, all at once, in a single interaction (not pairwise). The green, yellow colors represent the state (idea, position, political party...). (The hypergraph representation is from Ref. \cite{de-arruda-2020}).}
    \label{fig:SimpleComplexContagion}
\end{figure}

Simple contagion is often described as a process that involves only dyadic interactions, where the adoption of an idea or behavior is facilitated by direct contact between two individuals (see Fig. \ref{fig:SimpleComplexContagion}). This type of contagion is fundamental to understanding how information, beliefs, or diseases spread through populations via direct, pairwise connections \cite{pastor2001epidemic, newman2002spread}. Features of simple contagion include the rapid dissemination of information, continuous phase transition between full adoption - no adoption states, and the efficient spread of both beneficial and detrimental behaviors across social ties \cite{christakis2007spread, fowler2009cooperative}.

In contrast, Complex contagion takes place in scenarios where adoption is not merely a result of dyadic interactions but also involves group dynamics and/or the reinforcement from multiple sources within the network. This type of contagion often requires a critical mass or threshold of adopters at the individual's surroundings to trigger the adoption of information \cite{centola-2007,centola-2010}. This condition that characterizes complex contagion can be understood in two ways: (i) as a reinforcement of the idea or behavior from multiple pairwise (dyadic) interactions \cite{centola-2007,centola-2010}, or (ii) as a reinforcement from multiple sources in a single group interaction (higher-order interaction) \cite{iacopini-2019,de-arruda-2020,battiston-2021}. In the first case, the peer pressure, characteristic of complex contagion processes, is included into the model, which is designed to be used a simple network of dyadic social contacts. In the second case, the group interaction is included in a higher-order network or hypergraph \cite{berge1984hypergraphs}, which is a more general representation of the social contacts where the interactions are not restricted to dyads. In this case, the complex contagion process takes place via a single group interaction. See Fig. \ref{fig:SimpleComplexContagion} for a graphical representation of the different examples of complex contagion. Features of complex contagion include global cascades of adoption, discontinuous phase transitions, and the emergence of echo chambers and polarization in social networks \cite{centola-2007,diaz-diaz-2022}.

%Granovetter's work on threshold models of collective behavior further illuminates this concept by exploring how individual thresholds for action or adoption depend on the proportion of others adopting the behavior, highlighting the nonlinear nature of social influence and the importance of group interaction in complex contagion processes \cite{granovetter-1978}.

Moreover, real-world processes are influenced not solely by either simple or complex contagion mechanisms but by a complex interaction between the two (Hybrid contagion) \cite{min-2018,diaz-diaz-2022}. Such multifaceted interactions give rise to varied outcomes, including phenomena like discontinuous transitions, tricriticality, and echo chambers emergence , all of which profoundly affect how information is spread, how behaviors are adopted, and how collective actions are formed.

There have been attempts to extract the simple/complex nature of a process from real data. For example, by analyzing the correlation between the infection order of network nodes and their local topology, it is possible to infer the type of contagion process that is taking place \cite{cencetti-2023}. Nevertheless, the classification of contagion processes remains a challenging task, as the dynamics of social contagion are influenced by a multitude of factors and high-quality data related to the infection process is often scarce.

\section{\label{sec:Granovetter-Watts threshold model} Granovetter-Watts threshold model}

In this thesis, we are interested in the dynamics of complex contagion driven by multiple interactions in a network of dyadic social contacts. In particular, we focus on a particular category of models called \textbf{threshold models}.

Threshold models represent a critical conceptual framework in understanding how individual behaviors aggregate to produce collective outcomes, especially in contexts where decisions are influenced by the actions of others \cite{granovetter-1973,granovetter-1978}. By defining a "threshold" — the point at which an individual's perception of the collective behavior of others prompts them to act — these models offer insights into the pivotal role of social influence and network structure in driving large-scale changes from small initial actions \cite{dodds-2004}. Rooted in the interdisciplinary nexus of sociology, economics, and network theory, these models illuminate the mechanics behind phenomena as diverse as social movements, technological adoption, market dynamics, and even cascading failures within infrastructures. All these phenomena share a common thread: the need for a critical mass of adopters to trigger a response, a threshold that must be crossed to initiate a cascade of adoption \cite{centola-2007,centola-2010}.

When we talk about threshold models, the model that comes to our minds is the threshold model introduced by Mark Granovetter in 1978 \cite{granovetter-1978}, exploring how individual adoptions depend on the proportion of others adopting the behavior, highlighting the nonlinear nature of social influence and the importance of group interaction in complex contagion processes. In this model, each individual has a threshold that determines the number of neighbors they need to observe adopting a behavior before they themselves adopt it. This threshold can be interpreted as a measure of an individual's susceptibility to social influence, capturing the idea that some people are more likely to adopt a behavior if they see few other people doing the same, while others may require more convincing or reinforcement before they act. This concept of threshold was was inspired from Thomas C. Schelling work on segregation \cite{schelling-1969}, in which the threshold is understood as the maximum tolerance of different neighbors that an individual can withstand before changing their behavior. Duncan J. Watts, in 2002, built upon Granovetter's concept, applying mathematical analysis to explore the model within complex networks \cite{watts-2002} . His work, particularly on how minor initial actions can lead to large cascades, further elucidated the cascade condition dependence on both individual thresholds and network structures. This model, named as the Granovetter-Watts threshold model, has since become a cornerstone of research on complex contagion and collective behavior, offering a powerful lens through which to study the cascade dynamics in complex networks.

\begin{theorem}[Granovetter-Watts model]
    \sffamily\small
    An individual time step of the model is defined as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Each node $i$ has a threshold $R_i$.
        \item At each time step, a node $i$ is selected at random.
        \item If the fraction of active neighbors of $i$ is greater than $R_i$, then $i$ becomes active.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The Granovetter-Watts model exhibits a phase transition from a regime where the adoption is rare, where there are only small cascades of adoption and none of them is global, to a regime where the adoption is widespread, where there are large cascades that reach all the system. This phase transition is discontinuous \cite{watts-2002,gleeson-2007}, and it is characterized by a critical threshold value $R_c$ that separates the two regimes (refer to Fig. \ref{fig:Cascade_gleeson}). The regime where the global cascades are rare,small and localized is a supercritical regime $R > R_c$ while the regime where cascades are fast and global is subcritical $R \leq R_c$. The  discontinuous transition between the two regimes is driven by the interplay between the individual thresholds and the network structure, and it is a result of the collective dynamics of the system (see dependence of $R_c$ with the average degree in Fig. \ref{fig:Cascade_gleeson}).

The exploration of this model has been widespread, encompassing studies on various types of networks including regular lattices and small-world networks \cite{centola-2007}, as well as on random graphs \cite{gleeson-2007}. It has also been examined within the contexts of networks with modular and community structures \cite{gleeson-2008}, networks that exhibit clustering \cite{hackett-2011,hackett-2013}, hypergraphs \cite{de-arruda-2020}, and networks characterized by homophily \cite{diaz-diaz-2022}, among others. In addition, the literature has expanded to cover the effects of varying the rules for adoption, such as incorporating social reinforcement across multiple layers \cite{chen-2018}, examining the influence of opinion leaders and initial seed size on the process \cite{liu-2018, singh-2013}, the introduction of on-off thresholds \cite{dodds-2013}, and analyzing the dynamics when simple contagions compete with complex ones \cite{czaplicka-2016, min-2018, diaz-diaz-2022}. Further, empirical data have been used to test the predictions of the Granovetter-Watts model, demonstrating its applicability across a wide range of real-world situations \cite{centola-2010, karimi-2013, karsai-2014, rosenthal-2015, karsai-2016, mnsted-2017, unicomb-2018, guilbeault-2021}.

\section{\label{sec:The Sakoda-Schelling model} The Sakoda-Schelling model}

Thomas C. Schelling's segregation model \cite{schelling-1969}, illustrates how individual preferences regarding neighbors can lead to significant segregation in urban areas, even when these preferences are relatively mild. The model utilizes a checkerboard setup where each agent (representing a household) prefers to live in a neighborhood where at least a certain percentage of neighbors are of the same type (see Fig. \ref{fig:Schelling_fig}). There are locations in the checkerboard that do not have an agent, these will be called vacancies. Agents move to a new vacancy location if their tolerance threshold is not met \footnote{Note that this  tolerance threshold acts as a measure of a critical mass of different neighbors that the individual tolerates (large tolerance allows for more diverse neighborhood while small tolerance requires several similar neighbors to be satisfied). This threshold definition is complementary to the one in the Granovetter-Watts model, where it is a measure of the number of similar neighbors required to adopt (small threshold allows to adopt with a more diverse neighborhood while large threshold requires several similar neighbors to adopt).}. This simple rule leads to complex patterns, showing that even a slight preference for similar neighbors can result in highly segregated communities, an insight that has profound implications for understanding social dynamics and urban planning. 

\begin{theorem}[Schelling's model]
    \sffamily\small
    An individual time step of the model is defined as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Each node $i$ has a tolerance threshold $T_i$.
        \item At each time step, a node $i$ is selected at random.
        \item If the fraction of different kind neighbors of $i$ is greater than $T_i$, then $i$ moves to a neighboring location where the fraction of different kind neighbors is less than $T_i$.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item If there is no available location, then $i$ remains in the same location.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

On the other hand, James M. Sakoda's model, initially conceptualized in his 1949 dissertation and fully introduced in Ref. \cite{sakoda1971checkerboard}, offers a more nuanced approach to modeling social interactions using a similar checkerboard framework. Unlike Schelling's, Sakoda's model incorporates a broader range of social interactions by allowing agents to exhibit positive, neutral, or negative attitudes towards their neighbors. These attitudes influence the agents' movements across the board, aiming to optimize their local environment according to specific utility functions that aggregate the effects of surrounding agents. Sakoda's model is capable of simulating a variety of social phenomena beyond segregation, such as the formation of stable social clusters and the dynamics of group interactions \cite{hegselmann-2017}. 

An important contribution associated to both models is the use of a checkerboard setup as the computational space where agents (or tokens) reside and interact according to predefined rules. The ``hand-made'' simulations performed by Sakoda and Schelling using this discrete spatial representation has since become a standard framework for studying agent-based models in social systems \cite{hegselmann-2017}. This structure allows for the exploration of local interactions, emergence of global patterns and interface analysis, providing a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of social systems.

\begin{theorem}[Sakoda's model]
    \sffamily\small
    An individual time step of the model is defined as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Each node $i$ has an attitude matrix $A_i$, that defines the attitudes of $i$ towards all other agents on the board.
        \item At each time step, a node $i$ is selected at random.
        \item $i$ evaluates the total utility for each neighboring location based on the sum of influences (according to the attitudes) from all other agents on the board, weighted by distance.
        \item $i$ moves to the available location with the highest utility.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The results of the Schelling's model demonstrated how even mild personal preferences can unexpectedly lead to significant spatial segregation. Its insights have been applied across economics, sociology, urban planning, and complexity science, profoundly influencing both academic research and practical policy discussions. Schelling's model became a foundational example in agent-based modeling, helping to educate countless researchers and practitioners about the impact of individual actions on broader social patterns. Nevertheless, when we check the update rules, we observe that the Schelling's model is a particular case of the previous Sakoda's model, where agents have a negative attitude towards different-kind agents and a fixed tolerance threshold $T_i$. To honor the original contributions of both authors, we refer to this model through the thesis as the Sakoda-Schelling model.

In both cases, the author show at the left the initial configuration of the board and at the right the final segregated configuration after several iterations.}
    \label{fig:Schelling_fig}
\end{figure}

In particular, the Sakoda-Schelling model has been studied from a Statistical Physics point of view due to its close relation to different forms of Kinetic Ising-like models \cite{stauffer-2007,stauffer-2013}, and also addressing general questions of clustering and domain growth phenomena, as well as for the existence of phase transitions from segregated to non-segregated phases. For example, the relation with phase separation in binary mixtures has been considered \cite{Dall_Asta_2008,Vinkovic}, as well as the connection with the phase diagram of spin-1 Hamiltonians \cite{BEG,BlumeCapel,Gauvin_2009,Gauvin_2010}. In this context, a useful classification of models is to distinguish between two possible types of dynamics \cite{Dall_Asta_2008}: \textbf{``constrained''}, where unsatisfied agents just move to satisfying vacancies (if possible), and \textbf{``unconstrained''},  where each agent try to improve its satisfaction, but after a move they may remain unsatisfied. In addition, the motion can be short-range (only to neighboring sites, as in the original model) or long-range. Constrained motion has been named ``solid-like'' because it generally leads to frozen small clusters, while unconstrained motion has been considered ``liquid-like'' because it allows for large growing clusters \cite{Vinkovic}. Including the motion of satisfied agents leads to a noisy effect playing the role of temperature in a statistical physics approach \cite{Gauvin_2009,Gauvin_2010}.

Despite there has been many attempt in the literature, the description of the phase diagram and the transitions in the Sakoda-Schelling model is a difficult task. In Ref. \cite{lucquiaud2022modeliser}, the authors need to reduce the model to a simpler binary-state version that allows to obtain the phase transition from a segregated to a mixed phase.

\section{\label{sec:Theoretical Framework} Theoretical Framework}

To explain the emergent properties exhibited by the agent based models and its computer simulations, we need to develop a theoretical framework that captures the essential features of the system. This framework should provide a mathematical description of the dynamics, allowing us to analyze the system's behavior and predict its evolution over time. In the context of social contagion and collective behavior, the theoretical framework typically involves a set of differential equations or master equations that describe the evolution of the system's state variables.

The theoretical framework for agent-based models running in complex networks can be broadly classified into two main categories: mean-field approaches and network-based approaches \cite{barrat-2008}. The so-called mean-field\footnote{Mean-field is a term borrowed from statistical physics, where it refers to the approximation of the interactions between particles by an average field. In the context of networks, mean-field is related to the approximations of ignoring the local effects and assuming all-to-all connections and infinite system size.} approaches treat the system as a homogeneous entity, where each agent interacts with the average behavior of the entire population. These approaches are well-suited for capturing the macroscopic dynamics of the system and are particularly useful for understanding the collective behavior that emerges from individual interactions. Network-based approaches, on the other hand, explicitly model the interactions between agents as a network structure, where nodes represent agents and edges represent interactions between them. These approaches are valuable for capturing the influence of the underlying network structure on the system's dynamics and for studying the impact of network properties on the spread of information and ideas.

\subsection{\label{sec:Approximate Master Equation} Approximate Master Equation}

A general framework for binary-state models in complex networks was developed by J. P. Gleeson \cite{gleeson-2011,gleeson-2013}, which provides a general set of differential equations, the Approximate Master Equation (AME), to describe the dynamics of any Markovian binary-state model on a generic network. This framework has been widely used to study the dynamics of social contagion, opinion formation, consensus problems, and other collective behaviors in complex networks. The framework is particularly very useful in the context of thresholds models, which are not well suited for a mean-field approach \cite{gleeson-2007}, allowing us to identify phase transitions, compute critical thresholds, and predict the final state of the system. The full AME description and derivation can be found in Ref. \cite{gleeson-2013}, but we will provide a brief summary of the main concepts here.

Consider a system of $N$ nodes in a network, where each node can be in one of two states: $+1$ or $-1$. The state of each node evolves over time according to a set of rules that depend on the states of its neighbors. Let us consider a node $i$, with a degree $k$ (i.e., $k$ connections to other nodes) and $m$ neighbors of $i$ in state $-1$ (e.g., ``adopter''). If node $i$ is in state $+1$ (e.g., ``non-adopter''), the rate \( T^{+}_{k,m} \) defines the probability per unit time that $i$ will switch to state $-1$. Similarly, \( T^{-}_{k,m} \) defines the probability per unit time for $i$, in state $-1$, to switch to state $+1$. These rates are, in general, functions of both the degree $k$ and the number $m$ of neighbors in state $-1$, reflecting how the local network configuration influences state transitions.

Taking into account this framework, the AME can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dt} x^{\pm}_{k,m} = -T^{\pm}_{k,m} x^{\pm}_{k,m} + T^{\mp}_{k,m} x^{\mp}_{k,m} - (k-m) \beta^{\pm} x^{\pm}_{k,m} + (k-m+1) \beta^{\pm} x^{\pm}_{k,m-1} - m \gamma^{\pm} x^{\pm}_{k,m} + (m+1) \gamma^{\pm} x^{\pm}_{k,m+1}
\end{equation}

Here, $x^{+}_{k,m}$ and $x^{-}_{k,m}$ represent the fractions of nodes with degree $k$ and $m$ infected neighbors that are in state $+1$ and $-1$, respectively. $\beta^{\pm}$ and $\gamma^{\pm}$ are time-dependent rates that describe how the adoption process spreads and recedes across the edges of the network, encapsulating the network's dynamic connectivity and its influence on the spread of states.

A key advantage of the AME is its ability to capture the complex dynamics of networks by considering the interactions between neighboring nodes, making it more accurate than simpler models like the mean-field theory, which assumes independence between nodes. Moreover, from the AME, one can approximate the shape of the solutions $x^{\pm}_{k,m} (t)$ to reduce the number of differential equations, recovering the pair approximation and the heterogeneous mean field \cite{gleeson-2011,gleeson-2013}.

On the other hand, the AME assumes a tree-like structure with negligible levels of clustering. This assumption implies that there are very few short loops in the network. This tree-like assumption simplifies the calculation and application of the AME by reducing the network's complexity, and becomes very useful for networks generated with the configuration model \cite{newman-book}, with any given degree distribution, at the limit $N \to \infty$. Another limitation of the AME is based on the formulation itself, since framework is built assuming binary-state Markovian dynamics, which may not always accurately capture the real-world dynamics of social contagion. In fact, in next section, we will introduce the concept of bursty human dynamics, which is is an empirical evidence of the presence of non-Markovian effects. This effects can significantly impact the dynamics of social contagion processes.

\section{\label{sec: Bursty Human Dynamics} Bursty Human Dynamics}

Bursty behavior refers to the irregular and sporadically temporal patterns of interactions that include natural phenomena, like earthquakes and neuron firing, as well as human activities, such as communication, mobility, and social dynamics. This section delves into the characteristics of bursty behavior, highlighting by empirical evidence, and discusses its significant implications for modeling human behavior.

Human activities often exhibit complex temporal patterns characterized by bursts---short periods of high activity interspersed with longer periods of inactivity (see examples Fig. \ref{fig:bursty_human_dynamics}(a-c)). This non-Poissonian behavior, referred to as burstiness, manifests across diverse human-driven processes and is extensively documented in communication dynamics, web browsing habits, and social interactions \cite{Barabasi2005Bursts, Vazquez2006Bursts}. The seminal work, by A. L. Barabási \cite{Barabasi2005Bursts}, shown from email communication's data that activity periods do not follow a regular pattern but are clustered in bursts. This phenomenon has since been observed universally across various platforms such as mobile phone calls, emails, tweets, text messaging and social media \cite{karsai-2011, Miritello2013Capacity,moro,artime-2017,rybski-2012,zignani-2016,kumar-2020,iribarren-2009}. Further research has analyzed burstiness, focusing on the persistence and periodicity of human interactions \cite{Clauset2007Proximity} or the effects of circadian rhythms \cite{Jo2012Circadian}, and has extended these analyses to web activity to predict behaviors across different online platforms \cite{Radicchi2009WebActivity}.

An important evidence of bursty dynamics is the heavy-tailed distribution of inter-event times, indicating that the probability of short inter-event times is higher than expected from a Poisson process (see Fig. \ref{fig:bursty_human_dynamics}(c)). As a result of this bursty human behavior, there is an emergence of heterogenous degree distributions \cite{Muchnik2013PowerLaw}, which have been observed in many social systems \cite{barabasi2009scale}. Further insights into the impact of burstiness on system dynamics come from studies linking it to memory and the structured nature of human dialogues, enhancing our understanding of how past interactions influence future activities \cite{karsai2012universal, Goh2008Burstiness, Eckmann2004Entropy}.

\end{figure}

Traditional models based usually rely on numerical simulations to update agents following independent random Poisson processes, called Random Asyncronous Update (RAU), in which the characteristic time a node is updated is the Monte Carlo step, in which all agents has been updated once on average \cite{fernandez-gracia-2011}. In this process, an exponential interevent time distribution is expected, which does not capture the bursty nature of human dynamics. To address this phenomenon, non-Poissonian models are necessary to provide a better fit for empirical observations \cite{Vazquez2006Bursts}. We differentiate two main approaches to include bursty human dynamics in our models:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Activity-driven models (nodes get activated):} These models incorporate the temporal aspects of human activity by assigning activity potentials to nodes within a network, dictating the likelihood of interactions based on observed human activity patterns \cite{Stark2008,van-mieghem-2013,starnini-2017}.
    \item \textbf{Temporal networks (links get activated):} These models incorporate time-stamped interactions, such that at each time step our interaction network changes \cite{Holme2012Temporal, Perra2012ActivityDriven}.
\end{itemize}

While both approaches have been successful to include bursty human dynamics, they offer different perspectives on the underlying mechanisms driving these behaviors: activity-driven models emphasize the burstiness of individual attempts to interact with others, while temporal networks focus on the burstiness of the interactions themselves. The choice of model depends on the specific research question and the level of detail required to capture the dynamics of interest.

It has been shown that implications of bursty behavior are dramatic, influencing the dynamics of network processes such as the spread of epidemics and information diffusion \cite{Rocha2013Bursts, Wang2009Viruses}. Understanding the mechanism behind this burstiness allows us to improve our predictions, aligning them more closely with natural human activity patterns.

\section{\label{sec:Aging mechanism} Aging mechanism}

`The concept of ``Aging'' is understood in many different ways in the literature. For us, aging is one form of memory effect on which the rate of interactions depends on the persistence time of an agent in a state, modifying the transition to a different state \cite{fernandez-gracia-2011,perez-2016,boguna-2014}. 

This concept of aging was introduced in \cite{Stark2008} taking as inspiration the non-equilibrium dynamics of spin glasses, where the effective temperature of the system changes with the time since a given perturbation was applied \cite{cugliandolo1993analytical}. In a context of social systems, this resistance to change can be interpreted as conformism or laziness. In models of species competition \cite{ravasz2004spreading}, this would imply that neighboring species are less likely to be displaced at a later stage of growth \cite{Stark2008}. In our words, the motivation behind the aging mechanism is to capture the tendency of individuals to stick to their previous beliefs or habits, a common feature in human behavior \cite{granovetter-1973}. In other words, the longer an individual holds a particular habit, the more he/she will accumulate experience, leading to a higher self-involvement and resistance to change \cite{lejarraga2011let}. Moreover, this emotional attachment balances the memory-less and purely rational considerations of traditional models \cite{granovetter-1985}.

The aging mechanism is a non-Markovian effect that can be included in a model via an activation function that modifies the transition rates between states (activity driven model). This function depends on the time since the last transition, allowing us to include bursty dynamics in the individuals' attempts to interact with others (given a proper choice of the activation function \cite{fernandez-gracia-2011}). This activation function is build such that probability of an individual to interact with another individual decreases with the persistence time in a given state, even though there are studies that also account for anti-aging mechanisms (probability to interact increases) \cite{peralta-2020,chen-2020}.

\subsection{\label{sec:Aging in pairwise interactions} Aging in pairwise interactions}

Aging effects have been already shown to modify drastically the dynamics in the Voter model \cite{Voter-original}, a popular framework for exploring consensus formation in statistical physics and social dynamic. The Voter model is a simple model of opinion dynamics, where agents update their state by copying the state of a randomly selected neighbor. This rules lead to dynamically active state that reaches consensus as a finite-size effect in a finite time, but consensus is not reached at the thermodynamic limit \cite{Voter-original}. It is shown that, while aging can decelerate microdynamics by making state changes less frequent as agents' states age, it can accelerate macrodynamics, leading the dynamics to a well-defined coarsening process, allowing the system to reach consensus even in the thermodynamic limit cite{Stark2008,fernandez-gracia-2011, perez-2016, boguna-2014, perez-2016, peralta-2020C}. This effect is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:aging_pdf}(a), where the aging mechanism is able to modify the dynamics of the Voter model, leading to a faster consensus of the minority state.

In terms of stability, in Voter-like models, incorporating aging exhibit a higher tendency toward reaching consensus than their non-aging counterparts. The persistence of the majority state, reinforced by aging, contributes to this stabilization, making aging a significant factor in determining which is the consensus state \cite{artime2019herding, peralta-2020, baron2022analytical}. As an example, aging modifies the nature of the noise-driven phase transition in the noisy Voter model. Specifically, it transforms a finite-size discontinuous transition between ordered and disordered phases into a continuous transition that falls into Ising universality class \cite{artime-2018} (see discontinuous transition for noisy Voter model in Fig. \ref{fig:aging_pdf}(b) and the continuous transition when aging is included in Fig. \ref{fig:aging_pdf}(c)).

Regarding models of multiple pairwise interactions or higher-order interactions, the aging implications are still an open question and it is a topic of current research. Just for the specific case of the noisy majority vote model \cite{chen-2020}, it is known that aging mechanism is able to modify the critical point of the noise-driven disordered-ordered phase transition \footnote{The noisy majority voter model exhibits a continuous phase transition from an ordered phase, where the system reaches consensus according to the majority in the system, to a disordered phase, where consensus is not reached.}. Further research is needed to understand the joint effect of aging and multiple interactions.
