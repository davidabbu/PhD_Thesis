\section*{Abstract}

In complex systems distributed transactional memory (DTM) systems are a very useful tool for concurrent programming. These systems allow software developers to write concurrent code without having to worry about managing shared memory. In addition, DTM systems offer a very simple interface for concurrent programming, as they allow software developers to write concurrent code in a similar way to how they would if the code were sequential. However, DTM systems are not a perfect tool, as they have a much lower performance than distributed data structures. In addition, DTM systems are not able to manage distributed data structures efficiently. For this reason, DTM systems are not a suitable tool for programming distributed systems.
