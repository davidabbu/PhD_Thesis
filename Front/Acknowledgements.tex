First, I would like to express my gratitude to my two directors and main collaborators through this thesis, Jos\'e J. Ramasco and Maxi San Miguel. I am very grateful for their educational and professional guidance through this path, which has been fundamental to reach this point. In particular, Jose has been a constant guide, and I am very grateful that his door always remained open for me, available for any question or doubt that could take 5 minutes or 5 hours to solve. Maxi has been a great supervisor, I want to thank him for his critical view, his constant push to improve my work, and his questions that always made me think in a different way. I must also thank them for their financial support and generosity, which allowed me to do this three-year PhD without worrying much about money. I would also like to thank Vincenzo Nicosia, with whom I had the pleasure to do a research stay during the last year of my PhD. Collaborating with him allowed me to be part of the process of developing new ideas and projects, which has motivated me with new challenges and perspectives. In addition, throughout this period at IFISC, I thank having great conversations with scientists such as Juan Fern\'andez-Gracia, Konstantin Klemm and Damià Gomila, which have served as a source of inspiration and learning.

My firsts steps began in the Master in Physics of Complex Systems, where I had the opportunity to meet great people and friends. I would like to thank my classmates, Alex, Miguel, Marius, Robert, Javi, Medi, Joje, Ana. I want to acknowledge the great environment we had during those years, which motivated me to follow this path. Alex has not only been my master's colleague, I consider him as a partner though this journey. I thank all the moments helping each other, being victims of FPI-CAIB's injustices, promoting Julia as the best programming language and doing ``rutillas chill'' to both Massanella and Sabotage. I am very grateful that we did this path together, and I hope to be able to work someday in the Alex's Research Institute. Also, I want to thank Miguel for all the random videos during the pandemic, the curiosities in Google Maps and the funny random videos.

I also want to thank the really nice environment between PhD students and PostDocs at IFISC. It may seem something small, but you just need to go to work once alone to realize how important it is. From all IFISC Basement, I need to highlight a special place for me, the ``Zulo'', which was an almost-empty temporary lab of Nonlinear Physics when I got there, and we turned into a cozy place to work and fight for justice via posters. I want to thank being part of this group and having worked in (probably) the only theoretical physics office with a giant extractor hood.

Durante el doctorado, estoy agradecido de haber conocido a gente maravillosa como Manu. Agradezco las muchas (muchas muchas) conversaciones que hemos tenido a lo largo de estos años, ya sean a nivel professional como personal, ayudandonos con nuestras epidemias raras. Agradezco la esquina de despedida que nos ha visto hablar demasiado.
