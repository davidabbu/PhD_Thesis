I want to express my sincere and profound gratitude to my supervisors, Maxi San Miguel and José J. Ramasco. Their guidance and academic support have been fundamental during this thesis and have given me a different perspective on both work and life. Maxi, with his experience and his questions on key details, has provided invaluable insight, while José has been a constant and understanding guide. I appreciate that his door is always open for discussions that can go off on tangents and end up who knows where. I also want to deeply thank them for the financial support they have provided. Not having been lucky with doctoral scholarships, I have been able to complete this thesis thanks to their projects without having to worry about money. Their generosity has been key to completing this thesis. A special thanks to Vincenzo Nicosia, with whom I had the opportunity to do a research stay in London. Collaborating with him truly gave me good motivation and allowed me to start very interesting projects and be part of idea development. I am very excited to see where our work from those months will lead. Regarding the scientific aspect, I also want to thank other scientists with whom I have had very inspiring conversations along this journey, such as Juan Fernández Gracia, Raúl Toral, Konstantín Klemm, and Sandro Meloni. Conversations with them have been a constant source of inspiration and learning for me.

My first steps on this path began with the master's in Complex Systems. There, I had the fortune of enjoying the company of great students like Alex, Robert and Marius, Miguel, and those from the Pisito at that time: Javi, Medi, Jorge, and Ana. During that time, I am grateful for the good atmosphere we had among all of us, which motivated me to stay in this field. Alex has not only been a friend from the master's but we have made this entire journey together, helping each other, sharing dramas and laughs, with "chill" routes both to Massanella and Sabotage, and being victims of FPI-CAIB injustices year after year. I also want to mention Miguel with special affection, one of the most random people I know, and I really appreciate the random videos at mid-morning and Google Maps curiosities.

During the doctorate, I have been fortunate to have extraordinary companions like Manu. We have shared many conversations (when I say many, I mean many), both at the scientific and personal levels, supporting each other at all times and chatting about our rare epidemics. The beers at Sepia and the "cine" are moments I cherish dearly. I also want to thank Mar, a person with a very clear view of the world that inspires me and has made me laugh a lot over this time. Having a shoulder like hers to cry on is very comforting. I also want to thank Gorka for making me laugh, keeping me up to date with www.internet.com. We have spent great moments together, discussing all possible methods of community detection and why none of them are good. And of course, Fer, a companion of long talks discussing a thousand topics. I don't think there's any project at IFISC that we haven't discussed and talked about how we would do it ourselves. I am very grateful you came into my life because I was a bit lost with the doctorate when you arrived. Having such an academic person like you by my side has helped me follow this path. Plus, I'm fascinated with his incredible ability to sleep in strange places. I also appreciate having had Adrià by my side, the most restless person I have ever seen, I want to thank him in particular for the last Poster Party and for both ADSL. I also want to mention Alba and Manu P. for the laughs on the boat, even though we often drifted and the boat had many damp spots, sailing the waves together was great, and I have fond memories. As friends and companions on this journey, I also want to mention Bea, Mar Ferri, Pau, Pablo, Maria, Javi, Rodri, Irene, Lisa, José (Pepe), and Carmela. We have had a great time together, and I feel very grateful to have done the doctorate with you. I also want to especially thank my group from the Summoner's rift: Jesús, Manu, and Jun. Someday we will publish a paper on this (or not), and it will be epic. And if not, no one will take away the fun we've had.



I want to express my gratitude to IFISC for having such a friendly environment among Ph.D. students, for the Poster Party, and the winter and summer solstice. I also especially thank the ``Zulo''. When I arrived, S17 was an almost empty room, and we made that room our home, our headquarters from which to create combative posters. Perhaps one of the few theoretical physics offices in the world with an extractor hood.

Of course, I thank my father, my mother, my sister Adriana, Ivet, my new nephew Aleix, who is younger than this thesis, Josepa, Pau, and Mimi. You are my family; thank you for listening to me talk about work without understanding anything I say, and thank you for all the support until reaching here, both economic and emotional.

Also, I need to mention Rosa and Pau. You are love, and you make me very happy. I like being able to vent with you, and I am glad to thank you now for the role you have played, whether calming my worries about work or contracts or simply listening to me talk about my little things.

Finally, I want to thank to Riki, you have been the cornerstone of this period. Without you, there is no thesis; without you, I don't know what I would be doing with my life. I am very grateful for the very long audios you have listened to, talking for the thousandth time about how badly my day was due to work-related frustration, for being there supporting me from a distance or in person, for understanding my needs and helping me, for being understanding with this way I function both personally and work-wise. For everything, I thank you for walking this path with me. This thesis is as much mine as it is yours.
