    abstract = {Community structure is one of the main structural features of networks, revealing both their internal organization and the similarity of their elementary units. Despite the large variety of methods proposed to detect communities in graphs, there is a big need for multi-purpose techniques, able to handle different types of datasets and the subtleties of community structure. In this paper we present OSLOM (Order Statistics Local Optimization Method), the first method capable to detect clusters in networks accounting for edge directions, edge weights, overlapping communities, hierarchies and community dynamics. It is based on the local optimization of a fitness function expressing the statistical significance of clusters with respect to random fluctuations, which is estimated with tools of Extreme and Order Statistics. OSLOM can be used alone or as a refinement procedure of partitions/covers delivered by other techniques. We have also implemented sequential algorithms combining OSLOM with other fast techniques, so that the community structure of very large networks can be uncovered. Our method has a comparable performance as the best existing algorithms on artificial benchmark graphs. Several applications on real networks are shown as well. OSLOM is implemented in a freely available software (http://www.oslom.org), and we believe it will be a valuable tool in the analysis of networks.},

This paper seeks to move the focus on to the question of how best to model sub-markets once they have been identified. It focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of multilevel models as a technique for modelling sub-markets. The paper uses data on housing transactions from Perth, Western Australia, to develop and compare three competing sub-market modelling strategies. Model 1 consists of a city-wide ‘benchmark’; model 2 provides a series of sub-market-specific hedonic estimates (this is the ‘industry standard’) and models 3 and 4 provide two variants on the multilevel model (differentiated by variation in the degrees of spatial granularity embedded in the model structure). The results suggest that the more granular multilevel specification enhances empirical performance and reduces the incidence of non-random spatial errors.},

  abstract = {Submarket segmentation outlines an essential prerequisite for monitoring housing market and formulating urban housing policies. Although examining segmentation based on a posteriori knowledge rather than a priori knowledge becomes the mainstream, it follows a data-driven approach without a solid theoretical foundation and involves subjective interventions. Additionally, earlier studies have overwhelmingly examined the dynamics of sales submarkets while overlooking those of rental submarkets. This paper demonstrates a novel approach to segmenting the housing market by integrating the hedonic model, geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR), and machine learning, and further applies it to unpack the dynamics of sales submarkets and rental submarkets from 2018 to 2020 in Shanghai, China. More specifically, using the home-fixed panel data of housing sales prices and rental prices for each residential quarter, we first establish a series of hedonic models using GTWR and then aggregate the residential quarters into a number of submarkets using an affinity propagation clustering algorithm based on the produced spatiotemporally explicit coefficients. To validate the identified submarkets, we compare them to the static submarkets delineated by the real estate industry with respect to the performances of hedonic models. Finally, the Jaccard and Rand indices are applied to compare the magnitude of spatiotemporal dynamics of sales submarkets and rental submarkets. Results show that hedonic models based on the identified submarkets through our proposed method perform better than those based on the static submarkets delineated by the real estate industry. We also discover that the submarkets present a complex change over three years, especially in central urban areas. The dynamics between sales submarkets and rental submarkets are of significant differences. In particular, rental submarkets are more stable than sales submarkets. Our approach provides a practical and efficient tool for urban housing market segmentation. Our study highlights that differentiated policies should be formulated for regulating sales submarkets and rental submarkets in order to enhance housing affordability.},

	abstract = {The big data era facilitates the use of new online data sources in both academic and professional fields: In real estate, for instance, private Web data such as online property price estimates have become commonly used sources for investigating property markets. The quality of such data, however, has not been routinely assessed. This article therefore statistically analyzes the quality of Web data for mapping local property prices. To do so, it compares property estimates drawn from ten Web sites and property prices calculated from the Demande de Valeurs Foncières central state tax services database for a stratified sample of sixty French municipalities. This study reaches a paradoxical conclusion and theorizes it as a shift from market opacity to methodological opacity: Although it has become easier to obtain property price estimates at a local level, this commodified form of information is hardly suitable for geographical research on local property markets due to its varying, unpredictable quality. The partially disclosed or even missing metadata and methodologies make it indeed impossible to identify the sources of biases (sampling or stock vs. flow effects). The article shows that this methodological opacity is directly linked to the strategic role of copyrighted information in a context of property market reintermediation.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores the intersection of the housing market, technology and new online housing platforms, with a focus on the housing search process. The aim is to describe the current situation, explain its significance and to situate it within a wider context; both in relation to housing markets and the rise of so-called platform capitalism. The examples cited here are mainly drawn from the United Kingdom but the phenomena described can be seen in national contexts around the world. Following the introduction, the question of how contemporary developments might have changed the housing market is examined, in relation to the search process. Recent literature on the topic is then discussed. This helps situate the emerging literature on new sources of data, which in turn leads on to the question of short-term property rentals and what might be termed ‘the urbanisation of overconsumption’. The need for a critical perspective of these phenomena is then considered, with reference to an emerging literature, before the chapter draws to a close.},

	abstract = {Real estate property listings use specific language to market properties to a target buyer – typically one that will garner the largest profit. As home-seekers have different preferences for house characteristics and neighborhood amenities, the words used to advertise homes are expected to vary according to the type of neighborhood and expected homebuyer. In this article, we develop a framework for extracting the key characteristics used to advertise properties according to the racial and income profile of home mortgage applicants in different types of neighborhoods. We perform an exploratory text analysis on words according to neighborhood types and use a binomial logistic regression model to determine the most discriminatory words for each type of neighborhood. Finally, we assess the ability of the property listing text to predict the type of neighborhood the property belongs to. Using a small, illustrative case study of listings from Charlotte, North Carolina, we find that the presence of specific neighborhood names holds more importance in neighborhoods with primarily White homebuyers. In gentrifying neighborhoods, unique property characteristics such as parquet flooring, and words associated with revitalization near the city center are common. Listings in neighborhoods with minority homebuyers are less likely to mention schools and feature traditionally suburban descriptors such as cars, garage, and roadways. We envision that this framework, using near real-time data sources, holds the potential to advance neighborhood prediction efforts, our understanding of amenity preferences and sorting patterns, and to illuminate less visible processes of change such as discrimination in the housing market.},

  abstract = {Real estate agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, were surveyed to ascertain the nature and degree of any geographical bias in their evaluations of urban neighborhoods. Three hypotheses were confirmed: first, that realty companies cover limited portions of the housing market; second, that overall evaluations by realtors correspond to the vacancy pattern; and third, that individual real estate agents have highly localized views of which areas are appropriate for certain types of home buyers. These empirical findings have implications for the viewpoint that the metropolitan area acts as the information frame or "whole" in which intra-urban migration can be analyzed.},
